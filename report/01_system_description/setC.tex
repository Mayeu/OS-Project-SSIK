We want to try to implement the Dynamic Memory Management as an optional part of the project.

In the basic specification, it is allowed to have a fixed limit on the number of processes in the system, as well as fixed-length message queues. It is also not at all necessary to provide dynamic memory allocation as a service to user processes. In this extra credit requirement, you should remove these limits. In particular:

\begin{itemize}
  \item There should be a kernel module responsible for dynamically allocating memory for various purposes.
  \item  There should no longer be a compile-time fixed upper bound on the number of processes in the system, process control blocks should be allocated dynamically.
  \item  Message queues should be dynamic in size, allocating space only as needed.
  \item  Out-of-memory situations have to be gracefully handled.
  \item  A demonstration application should be written that demonstrates creation of processes and/or messages until memory runs out.
  \item  A demonstration application should be written that demonstrates the use of dynamic memory allocation in a process.
\end{itemize}

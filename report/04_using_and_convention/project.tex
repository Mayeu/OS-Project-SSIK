\chapter{Project}

The project name, \textbf{SSIK}, standing for: ``Simply \& Stupidly Implemented Kernel'', is the reversed acronym of \textbf{KISS}. \textbf{KISS} is an acronym for the design principle ``keep it simple and stupid''.

With this project we will try to follow this as a main rule.

\section{Folder hierarchie}

\begin{verbatim}
root
|- bin/
|- build/
|- doc/
|  |- kernel
|  |- user
|- doc_conf_kernel
|- doc_conf_user
|- include/
|- Makefile
|- README
|- report/
|- scripts/
|- src/
   |- kernel/
   |- user/
\end{verbatim}

Description of all the folder:
\begin{description}
  \item[bin/:] contain the final binarie
  \item[build/:] contain the object file
  \item[doc/kernel/:] contain the kernel documentation
  \item[doc/user/:] contain the user documentation
  \item[doc\_conf\_kernel:] doxygene configuration file for the kernel doc
  \item[doc\_conf\_user:] doxygene configuration file for the user doc
  \item[include/:] contain the API and system library header file
  \item[Makefile:] the project Makefile. Support many option, see further
  \item[README:] captain obvious prevent me to explain this
  \item[report/:] contain project report, such as this document
  \item[scripts/:] script folder, mainly for simisc
  \item[src/kernel/:] contain the code of the kernel
  \item[src/user/:] contain the code of all the user software
\end{description}

\section{Makefile}

The make file propose this option:
\begin{description}
  \item[all:] build everything
  \item[clean:] clean every build
  \item[doc:] generate user and kernel doc
  \item[indent:] indent all the source with the indent software
  \item[kernel:] only compile the kernel part. But don't link anything
  \item[kerneldoc:] generate kernel doc
  \item[user:] only compile the user part without the system library. But don't link anything
  \item[userdoc:] generate user doc, which correspond to the user API
  \item[run:] build everything and run the system in simisc
\end{description}

\section{Description}
\subsection{Process}

The process module handle Process creation, modification, information reading, settings supervised and supervision process etc. Also the management of lists of process (push/pop in the list, search in the lists, sorting, etc.)

\subsection{Scheduler}

The scheduler will be in charge to choose and pick the next process to run by following the rule of higher priority first and round robin for egal priority process.
This module will use the process module to search, read information about the process to be able to choose the next process.

\subsection{Error}

This module will provide some facility to print diagnostic and handle error (like the perror())

\subsection{Message Handling}

This module will provide function to pass message to different process. It also provie function to create/send/read/destroy message and also managing a list of message.

\subsection{System Library}

The system library will provide some basic and usefull function as printf(), getc(), etc. through system call to the kernel. This will also provide an interface to the other module of the kernel for the user.

This function will only be use by user software, kernel software will use the kernel library.

\subsection{Kernel Library}

The kernel Library will provide, at least, the same basic and usefull functions as the system library but ``directly'' without syscall. This function will only be called by kernel software.

\subsection{User software}

This module will provide a bunch of user program sure as a shell, curent process information, system information, requirement user program, etc.

\subsection{Kernel}

The ``kernel module'' will be in charge to setup the basic need of the kernel (default value, list of process, etc.) and launch the init process.

\subsection{Memory management (optionnal)}

This optionnal module will provide some dynamic memory management function. Without this module all the list (sure as process, message, etc.) will hava a static size.
